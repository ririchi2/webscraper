# Web Scraping and Text Extraction Tool

This Node.js script allows you to scrape a website and extract text content from it. It's a helpful tool for web developers who need to gather text content from a website for various purposes, such as website renovation or content analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd your-repo-name
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

4. Open the `index.js` file and replace `'your_website_url_here'` with the URL of the website you want to scrape.

5. Run the script.

```
npm run start
```

6. The extracted text will be saved to a file named `extracted_text.txt` in the same directory.

## Dependencies

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the website.
- [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio): A fast, flexible, and lean implementation of jQuery for server-side HTML parsing.
- [fs (File System)](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html): A built-in Node.js module used for file system operations.

## Customize

You can customize the script by adjusting the CSS selectors in the `textElements` variable to target specific HTML elements containing the text you want to extract. You can also modify the file path where the extracted text is saved in the `filePath` variable.

Feel free to explore and adapt this script to suit your specific web scraping needs.
